SICP
====

This repository contains my attempts at solving all SICP exercises,
with a file for each subsection.  As usual I'm using CHICKEN Scheme
for these, so some of the files may not work with other Scheme
implementations.  Nearly all files contain tests, therefore running
``csi -s ex.scm`` will print fancy stuff (assuming you've installed the
``test`` egg).
